the brand new cats-only wild west theme park, WhiskerWorld. You can't believe
your luck! You've heard there is a six month wait list, and somehow you were
chosen in the first week.     

You hop on the train at the station where you were told to go. Wow, look at all
these other cats going to WhiskerWorld! A calico cat wearing glasses, a small
brimmed hat, vest, and pocketwatch approaches you.

You look around and can't believe all the characters you see. The sheriff is
looking for good cats to join him on an adventure to arrest a gang of bandits.
Two black hat cats are circling each other and about to fight. Another cat
stands in the doorway of the saloon wearing a fancy silk and lace dress and calls
over to you.

'You're mew. Not much matted fur on you. Looking for a dish of milk?' she asks.
'Mmmm, some milk would be clawsome.' you say, and follow her into the saloon.
'You must be {}' she says as pouring the milk. 'Your reputation as a
skilled hunter pawceeds you! I'm Miss Kitty and this feline establishment
belongs to me. You're just the type of cat I was hoping to find!'

You lap up the milk and look up at her, a little confused. 'What do mean?' you
ask. 'Well, that milk is some of the best around. The Abermeowthy ranch provides
it to us every week. But this time, a gang of bandits stole the barrels before

over to the sheriff. He's still asking passersby if they can help capture the
outclaws. 'And you, my fine {} fur-iend! How about making our town safer
and earning a bit of a reward, too?' he says.

Out from behind Sheriff Pawkitt steps a large black cat with kind eyes, who says
'Howdy, pawtner! Glad to hear you're joining us.'

Once the sheriff has the mouse, you both walk back to the saloon. 'There he is,'

his eyes. 'Lion Leo, wake up!' says the sheriff. Startled, the cat springs to his

owe anybody no treats!' says Lion Leo. 'That's a matter for another day. Meow on

Sheriff Pawkitt, Teddy Fleas, and you climb up into the nearby mountains and

back to sur-purr-ise them. I'll confront them from the path. When I signal with
a hiss, attack! Then, use these collars to tie them up.'

slink low to the ground and see Hisstor, Armist-hiss, and two other bandits 
lapping up milk around the campfire. Then you see Sheriff Pawkitt approach. 
'Hisstor, it's time we had a talk,' he says. Hisstor looks up from his milk
with a scowl, 'Sheriff Pawkitt, I didn't think you had the nerve to come into
this part of the meowtain.' 'You're not going to slip the leash this time. We
can do this the lazy cat way or the crazed cat way,' the sheriff says.

You know the time is coming and your butt wiggles in anticipation of springing 
out of the darkness. 'You will never collar me!' roars Hisstor. The sheriff 
quickly throws the catnip mouse at Hisstor. He looks down at the mouse, a calm
look comes over his face, and he starts chewing and rubbing on the mouse. The
sheriff approaches with a collar. Hisstor springs up, knocking the sheriff to the
ground, 'You meowst be kitten me!' he says. 'Problem with the righteous... They
can't scratch for spit.' Sheriff Pawkitt stands up and lets out a loud hiss.
